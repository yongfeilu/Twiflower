### Third-Party Framework:
	In this app, we use Cocoapods to incorporate Alamofire, SwiftyJSON, and SwifteriOS to deal with
	the data we fetch from the APIs. Alamofire helps request and organize the data we get from the
	the Wikipedia API：https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php, SwiftyJSON helps parse JSON data from the
	APIs we use,) SDWebImage helps load images from the APIs, and SwifteriOS helps work with Twitter
	standard APIs (searching and filtering tweets according to our demands). We also use Reachability
	to keep track of the Internet connection, which is required to use the app.
